# RainPredictor

A simple, logistic regression based predictor to answer the question "Will it rain in Boise Tomorrow?"
As a simple project I gathered and cleaned all sources of data to build the most accurate classifier within my capabilites using only logistic regression to predict whether or not the it will rain in Boise tomorrow, based on todays data.

The process of feature engineering and data cleaning is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.
